# A-TABLEAU-PROJECT-Airbnb-Housing-Analysis
This project explores the 2016 Airbnb listings in Seattle, utilising data to analyse pricing trends and revenue generation across different zip codes. By leveraging Tableau, I created visualisations that provide insights into how location and property characteristics influence rental prices.
Key Visualizations
Price per Zipcode: A visual representation of average prices for Airbnb listings across Seattle's zip codes.
Price by Zipcode Revenue for the Year: An analysis of total revenue generated by each zip code throughout the year.
Average Price per Bedroom: A comparison of average rental prices based on the number of bedrooms available in listings.
Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings: An overview of the number of unique listings categorised by bedroom count.
Interactive Dashboard
An interactive dashboard consolidates these visualisations, allowing for dynamic data exploration. You can access the dashboard here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/golden.osabuohien/viz/AirBnBTableauProject_17269311214460/Dashboard1?publish=yes.
